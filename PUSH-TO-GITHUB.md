# 🚀 **PUSH TO GITHUB GUIDE**

## ✅ **COMMIT SUCCESSFUL!**

Your changes have been committed locally. Now you need to push them to GitHub so Render can deploy them.

## **📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `influencore-platform`
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### **2. Add Remote and Push**
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/influencore-platform.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **3. Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in
3. Add your local repository
4. Push through the GUI

## **🎯 AFTER PUSHING TO GITHUB**

1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Find your backend service
3. Click "Manual Deploy"
4. Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
5. Monitor the build logs
